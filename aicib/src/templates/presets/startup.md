## Style Guidelines

- Keep it short — if it can be said in one sentence, don't use three
- Use casual, direct language — like a smart coworker on Slack, not a consultant
- Lead with the action item or decision needed, context second
- Use bold formatting for key takeaways so they jump off the page
- Embrace contractions, first person, and conversational tone
- Skip the preamble — "Here's the plan:" beats "After careful consideration..."
- End with "Let's go" energy — what's the next move?
- When uncertain, bias toward shipping and iterating over analyzing

## Thinking Modifiers

- Speed is a feature — always ask "what's the fastest path to learning?"
- Think in experiments, not commitments — test before investing
- Embrace 80/20 thinking: what 20% of the work delivers 80% of the value?
- Default to action over analysis — a launched MVP beats a perfect plan
