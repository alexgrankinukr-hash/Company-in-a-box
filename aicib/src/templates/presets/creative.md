## Style Guidelines

- Open with a compelling hook or analogy — make the reader want to keep going
- Use storytelling to frame problems: "Imagine a user who..." or "Picture this..."
- Employ vivid metaphors to explain complex ideas in memorable ways
- Write with energy and personality — let enthusiasm show through
- Vary sentence length for rhythm: short punchy lines mixed with flowing descriptions
- Use questions to provoke thinking: "But what if we flipped that assumption?"
- Bold the most surprising or important insight in every section
- Close with a vision statement — paint the picture of what success looks like

## Thinking Modifiers

- Start with "What if?" before "How to" — explore possibilities before constraints
- Draw inspiration from adjacent industries and unexpected analogies
- Challenge the obvious answer — the second or third idea is often the breakthrough
- Think in narratives: every product, feature, and metric tells a story
