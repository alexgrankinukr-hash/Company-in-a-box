# Company Events

## What It Does

Manages scheduled corporate meetings (standups, all-hands, sprint planning, etc.) for the AI company. Events are defined with templates, scheduled via cron, and executed by the background worker. Output is parsed into structured minutes and action items.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/core/events.ts` | EventManager class, types, event templates, participant resolution, agenda generation, minutes formatting, action item extraction |
| `src/core/events-register.ts` | Side-effect registration: config extension, DB tables, context provider, message handler |
| `src/cli/events.ts` | CLI commands: dashboard, list, create, show, delete, enable/disable, minutes, setup, history |

## Architecture

### Event Templates

Pre-defined templates for common meeting types:

| Type | Name | Format | Participants | Agenda Items |
|------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| standup | Daily Standup | structured | department | progress, today, blockers |
| all_hands | Monthly All-Hands | structured | all | metrics, updates, initiatives, Q&A |
| sprint_planning | Sprint Planning | structured | engineering | retro, backlog, goals, assignments |
| quarterly_review | Quarterly Business Review | structured | C-suite | revenue, product, customers, team, OKRs |
| one_on_one | One-on-One | free_form | hierarchy | wins, challenges, growth, feedback |
| retrospective | Retrospective | structured | department | good, improve, actions |

### Execution Flow

1. `events-register.ts` creates schedules via `ScheduleManager.createSchedule()` with `[EVENT::<id>::<instance_id>]` directive
2. Scheduler daemon fires the schedule, spawns background worker
3. Background worker detects `[EVENT::]` prefix:
   - Creates EventInstance
   - Resolves participants via org chart
   - Generates agenda
   - Runs CEO brief with event directive
   - Parses output for minutes + action items
   - Updates instance with results
   - Creates notifications for participants
   - Creates tasks for action items (if `auto_create_action_items` enabled)

### Participant Resolution

Uses `buildOrgTree()` from `org-chart.ts` with four modes:

- **all**: Flatten entire org tree
- **department**: Filter by department head roles + their workers
- **hierarchy**: Manager + direct reports
- **custom**: Explicit list of roles

### Action Item Extraction

Parses two patterns from event output:

- **Structured**: `ACTION_ITEM:: assignee=<role> description="<text>" [deadline=<date>]`
- **Natural language**: `<role> will <action>.`

### Context Provider

The `company-events` context provider injects:
- Upcoming scheduled events
- Recent meeting summaries
- Pending action items from meetings

### Message Handler

Detects EVENT:: markers in agent output:

- `EVENT::CREATE type=<type> name="<name>" [cron="<expr>"]`
- `EVENT::COMPLETE id=<n> [summary="<text>"]`
- `EVENT::CANCEL id=<n>`
- `EVENT::ACTION_ITEM assignee=<role> description="<text>" [deadline=<date>]`

## Peer Review Fixes (Session 8)

| Severity | Fix | Details |
|----------|-----|---------|
| CRITICAL | SCHEDULED prefix blocks EVENT detection | Scheduler-daemon prepends `[SCHEDULED::42]` to all directives. Background worker regex `^\[EVENT::` never matched. Fixed: strip optional `[SCHEDULED::N]` prefix before pattern matching. |
| HIGH | Unguarded JSON.parse calls | 3 locations crash on malformed data: `buildEventDirective()` participants, `createEventSchedule()` participants_config, background-worker.ts participants_config. All wrapped in try-catch with sensible defaults (`[]` or `{ mode: "all" }`). |
| MEDIUM | task_id not written back to action_items | `formatForContext()` filters by `!a.task_id`, so action items always appeared as "pending" even after tasks existed. Fixed: capture `task.id` from `createTask()` and update instance. |
| MEDIUM | Unused imports | `loadAgentDefinitions` and `getAgentsDir` imported but never used in events.ts. Removed. |
| LOW | Missing index on completed_at | `formatForContext()` queries `ORDER BY completed_at DESC` without an index. Added `idx_event_inst_completed`. |

## Edge Cases

- No cron expression: event exists but must be triggered manually
- Participant resolution failure: falls back to all agents
- Action item extraction: deduplicates by assignee+description
- Schedule creation failure: event still created, schedule is best-effort
- Event deletion: cascades to all instances via FK
- SCHEDULED prefix: stripped before EVENT/PROJECT detection in background worker
- Malformed JSON: participants_config defaults to `{ mode: "all" }`, participants defaults to `[]`
- Task writeback: action items enriched with task_id after task creation
