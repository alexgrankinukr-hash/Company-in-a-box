# FreelancerPM -- CEO Status Report

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Run ID:** run_7f3a2b
**Brief:** "Build a project management SaaS for freelancers. Focus on invoicing, time tracking, and client portals. Target launch in 90 days."

---

## Progress Summary

All three departments have completed their initial deliverables:

- **CTO** -- Architecture finalized. Tech stack locked: Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL, React frontend. System diagram and API contracts drafted. No open blockers on the engineering side.
- **CFO** -- 12-month financial projection complete. Unit economics look healthy at a $19/mo price point (LTV/CAC ratio of 4.2x). Break-even projected at Month 9 with conservative assumptions.
- **CMO** -- Positioning document drafted. Primary persona identified: solo freelancers and consultants earning $75K-$200K/year. Launch channel strategy ranked and ready for review.

## Currently In Progress

- CTO is detailing the data model for the invoicing module (estimated completion: next run)
- CFO is running sensitivity analysis on two downside scenarios (higher CAC, higher churn)
- CMO is drafting the Product Hunt launch copy and landing page wireframe brief

## Blockers / Decisions Needed

1. **Pricing tier structure** -- CFO modeled a single $19/mo tier. CMO recommends adding a free tier for viral growth. Founder input needed: single paid tier or freemium model?
2. **Scope check on client portals** -- CTO flagged that full client portal functionality (file sharing, commenting, approvals) adds ~3 weeks to MVP timeline. Should we defer client portals to v1.1 and ship faster?

## Next Priorities

- Lock pricing decision so CFO can update projections and CMO can finalize positioning
- CTO to produce API endpoint specs for the invoicing and time-tracking modules
- CMO to draft 3 blog post outlines for pre-launch content funnel
- CEO to synthesize all department outputs into a founder-ready 1-pager after next run

## Run Stats

**Cost so far:** $1.23 (CEO: $0.42, CTO: $0.38, CFO: $0.21, CMO: $0.22)

**Confidence: 4/5** -- All departments aligned. The two open decisions (pricing model and client portal scope) are the only items preventing full confidence. Once the founder weighs in, we can move to execution phase.
