# FreelancerPM -- Positioning & Marketing Strategy

**Prepared by:** CMO Agent
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Draft v1 -- Awaiting founder review on pricing model before finalizing

## Target Audience

### Primary Persona: "Solo Sam"

- **Who:** Independent freelancers and consultants (design, development, copywriting, consulting)
- **Income range:** $75K-$200K/year
- **Team size:** Just them (maybe one VA)
- **Pain point:** Juggling 3-5 client projects at once with no unified system. Currently using a patchwork of spreadsheets, Notion, and manual invoicing
- **Motivation:** Wants to look professional, get paid faster, and stop losing track of hours
- **Where they hang out:** Reddit (r/freelance, r/webdev), Twitter/X, Hacker News, indie maker communities, Slack groups
- **Willingness to pay:** High -- they already pay for 4-6 SaaS tools that FreelancerPM can replace

### Secondary Persona: "Agency Amy"

- Small agency owner (2-5 people) who outgrew freelancer tools but finds enterprise PM software bloated and expensive. We will not target this persona at launch but should keep the door open architecturally.

## Key Differentiators

The headline here is: **FreelancerPM is the only PM tool built exclusively for solo freelancers who bill by the hour.**

1. **Invoicing is native, not bolted on.** Unlike Monday.com or Asana, invoices are generated directly from tracked time -- no CSV exports, no copy-pasting into QuickBooks.
2. **One tool replaces four.** Time tracking + project management + invoicing + client portal in a single $19/mo subscription. Most freelancers currently pay $40-$80/mo across Toggl, Notion, FreshBooks, and a file-sharing tool.
3. **Built for one person, not teams.** No seat-based pricing, no permissions matrices, no "workspace admin" overhead. Every feature assumes you are the only user.
4. **Client portal included.** Clients get a read-only view of project progress, deliverables, and invoices. No login required -- magic link access. Makes the freelancer look polished and professional.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor   | Strength              | Their Weakness (Our Opportunity)                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Monday.com   | Brand awareness       | Team-first design, confusing for solo users, expensive |
| Notion       | Flexibility           | No native invoicing, no time tracking, too open-ended |
| FreshBooks   | Invoicing             | No project management, no client portal              |
| Toggl Track  | Time tracking         | No invoicing, no project management                  |
| Bonsai       | Freelancer-focused    | Expensive ($29/mo), cluttered UI, tries to do everything |

## Messaging Framework

### Headline
**Stop juggling five apps. Manage projects, track time, and get paid -- all in one place.**

### Subheadline
FreelancerPM is the all-in-one project management tool built for freelancers who bill by the hour. $19/mo. No per-seat pricing. No enterprise bloat.

### Three Value Propositions

1. **Track time, generate invoices, get paid.** Your timesheet becomes your invoice in one click. Clients pay via Stripe. You see the money in 2 days.
2. **One dashboard for every project.** See deadlines, budgets, and hours across all your clients in a single view. No more tab-switching.
3. **Look professional without the overhead.** Give every client a branded portal where they can see progress, download deliverables, and approve invoices.

## Brand Voice

- **Tone:** Direct, friendly, slightly opinionated. We have a point of view: freelancers deserve better tools.
- **Register:** Conversational but not slangy. Write like a smart friend who happens to know about SaaS, not like a marketing brochure.
- **Do:** Use "you" and "your." Be specific with numbers. Acknowledge that freelancing is hard.
- **Don't:** Use corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem"). Don't talk down to the reader. Don't use exclamation marks in headlines.

## Content Funnel

### Awareness (Top of Funnel)
- Blog post: "The True Cost of Your Freelancer Tool Stack (We Did the Math)"
- Blog post: "Why Every PM Tool Is Built for Teams -- And Why That's a Problem for You"
- Twitter/X thread: "I tracked my freelance workflow for a week. Here's where I lost 6 hours."

### Consideration (Middle of Funnel)
- Comparison page: "FreelancerPM vs. Notion + Toggl + FreshBooks"
- Demo video: 90-second walkthrough showing time tracking to invoice to payment
- Case study: beta user testimonial (need to recruit 3-5 beta users pre-launch)

### Conversion (Bottom of Funnel)
- Landing page with clear CTA: "Start your 14-day free trial"
- Pricing page: single tier, no decision paralysis
- FAQ addressing top objections: "Can I import my data?", "What if I grow into a team?"

**Next step:** Founder to confirm pricing model (single tier vs. freemium) so we can finalize the landing page copy and Product Hunt listing.
