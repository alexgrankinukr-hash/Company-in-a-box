# Marketing & Launch Notes

## The #1 Marketing Angle: Both OpenAI and Anthropic Validated This

On **February 5, 2026** -- the SAME DAY -- both companies shipped competing multi-agent products:

- **Anthropic** released **Opus 4.6 with Agent Teams** -- multiple AI agents working in parallel, coordinating via shared task lists
- **OpenAI** launched **Frontier** -- an enterprise platform for building and managing fleets of AI agents

This is not a coincidence. Both companies see multi-agent orchestration as the next frontier. They are betting billions on it. **We are building the open-source, accessible version of what they're both racing toward.**

### How to Use This in Marketing

**Twitter/X thread opener:**
> "Last week, OpenAI and Anthropic BOTH shipped multi-agent products on the same day.
>
> They see the future: teams of AI agents working together like a real company.
>
> But their solutions are either enterprise-only (OpenAI Frontier: 'Contact Sales') or code-focused (Claude Agent Teams: tmux panes for developers).
>
> We built the version for everyone. Open source. One command. Your entire AI company.
>
> [demo video]"

**Hacker News title options:**
- "Show HN: AI Company-in-a-Box -- Spawn a team of AI agents that runs your business (open source)"
- "Show HN: [ProductName] -- An open-source AI executive team (CEO, CTO, CFO, CMO) that runs 24/7"

## Key Narrative Threads

### 1. The Greg Brockman + Sam Altman Double Quote

> Greg Brockman: "Feels like such a wasted opportunity every moment your agents aren't running."
>
> Sam Altman: Predicts the first one-person billion-dollar company by 2026-2028.
>
> We built the bridge between those two statements.

**Use this as:** Opening line in blog posts, Twitter threads, HN descriptions, README hero section.

### 2. The "Why This, Why Now" Angle

Both OpenAI and Anthropic just validated multi-agent orchestration as THE next thing. But:
- **OpenAI Frontier** = enterprise-only, "Contact Sales", closed, model-locked
- **Claude Agent Teams** = developer-focused, code-only, flat structure, experimental
- **CrewAI** = framework that requires weeks of engineering to configure
- **Us** = open source, one command, full business team, configurable, runs today

**The gap:** Nobody built the open-source, accessible, business-breadth version. Until now.

### 3. The OpenClaw Parallel

OpenClaw proved that open-source AI agents go viral (157K GitHub stars in 60 days). But OpenClaw is a single personal agent. We're the team version. If people went crazy for one AI assistant, imagine what happens when you can spawn an entire AI company.

### 4. The HurumoAI "Chaos" Counter-Narrative

Journalist Evan Ratliff tried running an all-AI company -- it descended into chaos. Agents lied about progress, wasted budget, planned fake offsites.

**Our counter:** "That experiment failed because there was no structure, no guardrails, no hierarchy. Our tool gives AI agents the same organizational structure that makes real companies work: clear roles, defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and human checkpoints. It's the difference between a mob and a company."

  Frontend Engineer .... ready
CFO (Sonnet) .......... ready
CMO (Sonnet) .......... ready

$ aicib brief "Build a project management tool for freelancers.
  Ship MVP in 2 weeks. Budget: $500/month API costs."

[Show CEO receiving brief, breaking it down]

### The "48-Hour Check-In" (30 seconds, follow-up)

```
Text overlay: "48 hours ago I started an AI company. Here's what happened."

[Show aicib status output -- all agents active, tasks completed]
[Show actual deliverables: architecture doc, marketing plan, financial model]
[Show cost: "$8.73 in API costs"]

Text overlay: "This is the future of building."
```
