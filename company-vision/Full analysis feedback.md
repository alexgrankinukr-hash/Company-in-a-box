Alright so quite a bit of things that you've written out so I have a high level overview of what I'm imagining so far that could become viral and I have and then I'll go through your feedback so my current thinking is I want a very cool system that's easily deployable and quickly customizable by somebody that can run in some cases 24/7 if you make it run 24/7 in some cases it runs on a schedule if you define some specific schedules in some cases it runs on on a trigger meaning every single one of those agents that the user might deploy can be configured as either run 24/7 but then you probably need an API key for that run on a schedule then you could probably run it with your cloud but I don't know maybe we can run it 24/7 as well but Not sure and run on a trigger meaning you send a message it does something Or if there's a web hook, it does something now What I'm imagining The ideal world I'm a see I'm the owner of the company I decided to sell something I Come See what I've developed and decide to publish it And Public start off the company operations What's gonna happen? I'm going to need to set up first The company employees Second The board of directors Let's start With the employees You can decide whether you are a CEO of the company Or you wanna hire a CEO By the way for each one of the roles We probably should have a specific identity for them Which we will add in time one by one But a few options for each one For example CEO can be very opinionated As a style Or be very agreeable Or very thoughtful etc Maybe we can combine a few styles at the same time Then you can choose what experience the CEO has Meaning For example this CEO Should be an expert In Car sales That has worked for the past 20 years in car sales And knows how car sales started How the sales process evolved Understands all car brands All channels of sales Customer profiles etc So for that We probably will need to Build profiles for each agent Every time from scratch For every Business owner But there will also be Pre-made Agents Meaning More generally CEO That will onboard Gradually learn about your Business When he sees any specific topic Or let's say you hire the CEO The trigger that happens is it goes off And starts researching about your business Business model what you want to do What kind of team you have etc And creates its own Knowledge base that with a vectorized approach or whatever the best approach to research things And then the CEO has a certain number of skills Like a skill to prepare strategy for the next quarter A skill to present A skill to communicate with every specific type of agent, etc.Then you can select the business functions that you want to have. Do you want to have a marketing function? What do you want your marketing function to look like? And then we can have a pre-made template but you can change it, i.e. Do you want a CMO? Or do you want without the CMO? Do you want a content writer? Then you can, of course, for each one of those agents, same as with CEO You can define the style of each agent And we're going to have to develop the style with you So for example if it's a CMO we're going to have to figure out what is the style of the CMO So we will together with you have to build each agent template with various styles and background templates And then but users can also customize them and trigger to build the profile or rebuild the profile that we have as a template Or build a completely new profile of a new agent in the team So for example for a team Marketing we might predefined things like a content writer SEO optimization analyst Product marketing, etc But the user might want to remove any of these or add some agent that the user doesn't have. That we don't have as a pre-made and he will build its personality. I think we can use soul.md files that Open CLAW has for each one of them. And then knowledge as in what is the expertise of this agent so that it downloads and your relevant docs, researches things but in the meantime he has a knowledge that is always there and knowledge that he can quickly reach and use some vector database or whatever the best approach to it and it can also go online and do some research. So, thus

Thus we will have different teams in the company and I think teams should be of course marketing team development team with a CTO and somebody below it product team finance team we could also have an HR team kind of HR meaning hiring and recruitment well so internal HR and recruitment in general that we can add and the HR can be both things from one perspective users can select that they charge should manage goals and whether the agents achieve those goals or not and some compensation for that. Also HR can theoretically manage hiring new agents so for example you can define a certain number of spending on tokens that you have per month and it CEO with the CTO CMO other heads of departments. Will work through to try to figure out what's the best allocation per department and then for example if a certain department needs another hire we know that the average amount of token spent per front-end developer is X per month. So you can hire a new guy. So we're gonna have one more software developer running in parallel that can work but you're gonna have to request HR to approve it HR request will be sent to CEO and CEO will communicate with you as the owner of the business. Now at the same time the HR can also be responsible for hiring and reviewing real personnel in your company humans meaning let's say you have ten people inside your company somebody requests a vacation then the HR will tell you: hey do you want to approve this or not? They will say yes i approve it and it works or somebody asks for a raise and all of those things are recorded and stored now HR could also request and ask you hey we need some management of the locations, can we integrate with something or do you want to do a request for the software team to build it for us with our requirements. You approve it, software development team goes off and builds it, gives it off to HR, HR reviews it thinks about the functionality, HR probably all of the agents should probably have some access to a browsing meaning not just web searching but using the browser to do stuff or maybe a computer environment to click on stuff and execute things but you can as a user when you're setting up company you can also decide whether you want this or not

Now thus as an owner of the business you will say for example you're a car salesman. You can set up a certain team and let them run with you and do things. So you will say hey here's my list of cars that I have bought this month you will ping a message to CFO saying please make sure he will say hey I bought this these cars see your foe can either automatically pick this up as context related to it and ask you hey saw that you message this in the main chat do you want me to log this into expenses he will say yes and then the CFO will pass it to accountant to financial forecaster and whatever then at the same time the sales people will be like okay we've got those cars to sell let us create the profiles of those cars and then they can figure out do we have our own website or not we have our own website let us work on putting those up on the website so we're gonna request software developers to create pages for those cars or maybe if we already have a system to add pages for those cars manually so meaning we don't need software developers sales guys can do that sales team of agents will go and add those there and then in the mean time of course as this kind of Chief Sales Officer will create those tasks so somebody will be delegated to create those pages somebody will create let's see sales chief sales officer can create the strategy of sales and how do you want to sell it who to target do some research or delegate research to people inside a department so sales researchers once the strategy is done the pages are created the guys will go ahead and start executing so trying to find the customer so might want that contacting them messaging them talking to them so you're going to have some real regular business development people who reach out try to get the first sale maybe even in the future we can connect a voice agent to it so that they can call people then account managers once a sale has gone through will do something else so it really depends of course on the business of the company and who needs to be in the company but that's the idea

Now, in terms of the board of directors, the cool idea of the board of directors that I have, and that's effectively how boards work, is you hire subject matter experts into your board. You have two, four, five, ten people in the board meeting that do either generic advisory so you as the company owner can decide how do you want to work with the board of directors. Meaning let's say you have four people. And then an example of accounts of sales of cars. You can have a guy, a profile that you create who is a past chief sales officer from Ford and another one is chief sales officer from Tesla, so he more specializes in electric cars. Then you can have somebody else or like a business owner that already built and sold his car company for whatever, 100 million dollars from scratch. And he knows the ins and downs of the business. And so now, let's say, when you're setting up the company, you can set up who is in the board of directors, what kind of styles they have and profiles because styles also matter. Meaning, one can be a harsh critic. One can be a flatterer. One can be a thoughtful advisor, etc. So style and background are two separate things.
And then, you can decide how do you work with the board of directors. We can have some pre-made templates. Meaning, board of directors monitors your main chat with everybody or maybe have a chat with C-Suite only. So other guys in the company don't see it so that they don't get bothered. And whenever they see a big decision or your request on something they analyze it and send you messages in dms or in the board meeting saying: Hey I saw you want to do this I don't think it's a good idea because of that! And then when somebody some of them send messages others immediately review them and think: Oh do I agree with it? Do I not agree with this? Maybe they do some search online. Look at their experience and reply as well to help you make better decisions. So that's kind of a proactive board. Reactive board is the one that you have to send the message to. It doesn't have access to the chat with cSuite and you have a separate chat with the board that you can send the messages to. With your ideas and they will evaluate them and critique them so that they can help you shape them and then you can work with a cSuite after that. The other option is the board of directors votes, meaning for certain decisions, you might not just want the feedback, but also voting on this to decide whether or not to do it, et cetera

So why I think this could be amazing is because instead of having Claude Code to do stuff for you, you can have this incredible system of employees within the company that can do autonomous work, delegate, communicate with each other. I think one of the key things like is… for example teams of agents now can be spawned in cloud and so what's interesting is that these agents can communicate now between each other. I don't know how they do it in cloud and how would we implement this? Would we have a generic framework that we do or would we have a more direct usage of teams of agents from cloud? But yeah, that's the whole idea. I think it could be an incredible system. Now the great thing about this is opposite from the OpenClaw that does a generic assistant that does everything on your Mac. You will have a business assistant, which is the next level and you can spawn off businesses. And I think in some way it's the future, where in the future as a business owner, a lot of things will be done by agents communicating with each other working. And instead of building direct sales start-up we do a start-up that creates an infrastructure for all of these agents and then from that maybe sales agents can use specific tools that they can subscribe to and use MCPs to use CRMs and software developers can request you to subscribe to Railway and Verso and then they will ask can we install the their MCPs are they the MCPs or not and then you do it as well

Also we have to have some customization of how much autonomy all of those guys will have. Meaning you can either decide to direct every decision to you from every single employee or you can allow some specific decisions to be made by the C-suite.
